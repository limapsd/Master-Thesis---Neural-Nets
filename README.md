# Master-Thesis - Neural-Nets
Some architectures that I used in my master's thesis when I was working with neural networks for financial forecasting of CDS models. The files here are not ready for reproducing results but to give an idea of what the architectures used in my [Master Thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AkVFyHie_r76Cfi2RNKb09H3stw_h_FE/view?usp=sharing).
