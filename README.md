# Master-Thesis - Neural-Nets
Some architetures that I used in my master thesis when I was working with Neural Networks used for financial forecasting of CDS models. The files here are not ready for reproducing results, but to give an idea of what are the architetures used in my [Master Thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AkVFyHie_r76Cfi2RNKb09H3stw_h_FE/view?usp=sharing).
